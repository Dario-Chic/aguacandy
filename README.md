# Aguacandy

Landing Page with a beautiful, simple, and minimalist design for a local Candy Store. It's a simple website, because it doesn't have too many functionalities, but it's outstanding for me because of the responsive slider I coded for services/products.

 It was simple but at the same time a difficult problem for resolving.

## Important Features

**Responsive Slider** 

As a Landing Page, it doesn't have too many special funcionalities, but for this website I developed one that I regard it's interesting because while I was coding it I couldn't find something alike on the web (stackoverflow ðŸ˜…) so I had to make it from scratch.

It is my "Responsive Slider", my main idea was to create two different views in differents devices.  An slider for mobile and a normal grid when the slider was too big.

After a while thinking about the flow and logical of the funcionality, both programming and styling, I got my first prototype. It worked, but the switch between sliders was too tough and zero smooth. So by a switch between classes and animations I could get a good result.

Now I'm working on improve this funcionality by adding more ways to switch between sliders (instead of only right and left) and adding a tactil funcionality for switching when user touches the slider fowards a direction.
